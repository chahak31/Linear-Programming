# Linear-Programming
Problems where the variables are real valued, the objective function is a linear function of the variables, and the hard constraints are linear inequalities

    Cost Function
    Constraints
    Enequalities(<= or = mostly)

Algorithms to solve LP:
  Simplex Algo
  Interior POint Algo
